# Single etcd server for now
# Example set/get from any host which can access HOST_IP:
#   curl -s -L http://$HOST_IP:4001/v2/stats/leader
#   curl -XPUT -d value="This is foo at $(date)" http://$HOST_IP:4001/v2/keys/tmp/test
#   curl http://$HOST_IP:4001/v2/keys/tmp/test
etcd:
  build: etcd

    PEER_PORT: "7001"
  ports:
  - "4001:4001"
  - "7001:7001"

# HAproxy with dynamic backends driven by confd
# HTTP backends can be added as follows (example from the host mac)
#   curl -XPUT -d value="www.perdu.com:80" http://$HOST_IP:4001/v2/keys/http/backends/perdu
# where "perdu" at the end of the URL must be a unique ID.
# Remove those URLs with an HTTP DELETE.
